Abstract

The "Speech to Text" project focuses on developing a system that accurately converts spoken language into written text using advanced speech recognition technologies. This system leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to process audio input, detect speech patterns, and transcribe spoken words into readable and editable text in real-time. The application is designed to support multiple languages and accents, making it versatile for various users and use cases such as transcription services, voice-activated assistants, and accessibility tools for individuals with hearing impairments. Key features include real-time processing, high accuracy, user-friendly interface, and optional cloud integration for data storage and processing. The project aims to bridge the gap between verbal and written communication, enhancing efficiency in both personal and professional environments.
